==========================
After completing the tasks and taling the screeshots, I copied my "SFTP" and ran it on my sandbox. I then gave the paswword provided.
Then I changed my directory using 'cd path' and created the required directory using 'mkdir'.
Then using the escape comannd line method "!command" i created the README.md file.
Then using the 'put localpath' command I uploaded the screenshots.
Then I exited the SFTP using 'exit'
Then i pushed my files to the repo.
